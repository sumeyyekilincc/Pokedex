# Pokedex 

This project utilizes the MVVM  architecture in a Flutter application. It employs various packages for different functionalities: 'http' for handling HTTP requests, 'connectivity_plus' for monitoring internet connectivity, 'provider' for state management, 'auto_route' for navigation, and 'auto_route_generator' for automatic route generation. These packages are used to organize different layers of the application and establish a robust structure.
